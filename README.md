# Material Design Practice

Add, experiment, modify this template to make your own awesome-ly design personal site.

For the Digital Design Workshop on Saturday, Nov. 21, 2015 at Punahou Schools.

### Let's get started!

First off, you'll be using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to run a pseudo-server on your local machine.

Alternatively you can drag the `index.html` file on top a browser window.

### Personalizing your template

There's so much you can customize in this template! But first, let's make it our own by inputing our name in the HTML.

- Open `index.html` and change the "MyName" texts in the `title` `aboutme` and `footer` sections.

Now were off to colors! Checkout `http://www.colourlovers.com/` for some inspiration. You'll be doing your color edits in the `css/styles.css` file.

To change the profile photo move a photo called `about_me.jpg` into the `img` folder.

Let's add some more in-depth content -- like a "Top 10" list! Work in the `inspiration.html` file. You'll be inserting images and a tagline for ten items. You can make any of these folders for categories of your "Top 10":

1. `top_10_goals`.
1. `top_10_books`.
1. `top_10_foods`.
1. `top_10_hobbies`.
1. `top_10_people`.
1. `top_10_places`.
1. `top_10_to_buy`.
1. `top_10_tv_movies`.
1. `top_10_videos`.

When you have created a folder using one of the names above you'll copy in 10 images and order them by `image_x.jpg` for example... `image_1.jpg, image_2.jpg, etc..". Don't forget to write the captions for each!

Refer to the `top_10.html` for pre-made html templates.

### Moving Forward!

Now that you've customized your own parts of the portal. Edit the other pages such as the `portfolio` and create a `blog` post using the pre-made html files.

You can totally use these as your boilerplate for making and publishing this template as your very own webpage!

If you have your own github account, perfect! If not, make one! It's completely free!
